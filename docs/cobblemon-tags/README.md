Important notes on certain Cobblemon tags!

The #cobblemon:is_cold tag is defined as being somewhat "cold" regardless of dimension, and includes more biomes than just those which can snow. Don't use it as a primary spawn condition or they'll spawn in places like The End and non-snowy biomes. We use it for anticonditions.

The #cobblemon:is_forest and #cobblemon:is_snowy_forest tags do not contain Taiga biomes. This is a Vanilla thing too.

The #cobblemon:is_hills tag and #cobblemon:is_peak tag are more narrowed down versions of the #cobblemon:is_mountain tag; is_mountain contains both of them, but is_hills defines less extreme mountains and is_peak defines the most extreme mountains.

The #cobblemon:is_sky tag is used for any biomes that feature islands floating in the sky, but is not for the air above other biomes or void biome types.

The #cobblemon:is_mushroom tag defines more than mushroom island biomes, as it includes any biomes which generally contain many mushrooms.

The #cobblemon:is_glacial tag is specifically for biomes that feature the use of a lot of ice blocks in generation rather than just snow.

The #cobblemon:is_beach tag and #cobblemon:is_coast tag are different in that the is_beach tag defines coastlines which are sandy specifically, whereas is_coast defines any coastline bordering the ocean. Is_beach is also kept entirely separate from cobblemon:is_sandy.

The #cobblemon:is_island tag and #cobblemon:is_tropical_island tag are different in that is_island defines any islands that generate in oceans, whereas is_tropical_island is for tropical ones specifically.

The #cobblemon:is_thermal tag and #cobblemon:is_volcanic tag are different in that is_thermal defines biomes with hot springs or are otherwise volcanically heated without lava, whereas the is_volcanic tag is used for biomes with many actual lava pits and flows.

There are a whole set of tags to be specifically used in the Nether under #cobblemon/nether:is_[name].

There are other tags which can be used for spawn biome conditions under #cobblemon/has_block:[name] which target biomes containing specific blocks, but these are also more likely to have trouble with biome mod compatability.
