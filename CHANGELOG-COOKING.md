### Additions
- Added the Campfire Pot, made from apricorns and placed onto campfires.
  - This pot can be used to make bait for fishing, Poké Cakes, Lure Cakes, local specialties, and potions (less efficiently than a brewing stand).
  - There is a different pot for each apricorn colour because at this point I think we may have an addiction.
- Added Aprijuice, made from the Campfire Pot using apricorns with seasoning to give flavours.
  - Aprijuice can be fed to ride-able Pokémon to improve their riding characteristics, depending on the flavour and the Pokémon's nature.
- Added Lure Cakes, made from the Campfire Pot using honey and berries.
  - Lure Cakes can be used to modify the spawn rate of Pokémon in the wild.
- Added the Saccharine Tree, which can be found in the wild and is used to obtain Honey Bottles.
  - The leaves of the tree can be harvested to obtain honey, which can be used in the Campfire Pot to make Lure Cakes.
  - The Log of the tree can be interacted with using a honey bottle to create a Honey-Slathered Saccharine Log, which increases the change of spawning a Pokémon with a Hidden Ability.
