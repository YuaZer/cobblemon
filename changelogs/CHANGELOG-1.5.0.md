## [1.5.0 - The Ruins and Revival Update (May 12th, 2024)](#1-5-0)
#### "You're telling me that Mojang has added archaeology to the game? Hmm... that gives me an idea."

### Additions
- Added 17 ruin structures, where you can find Pokémon-themed Armor Trims and Pottery Sherds, Tumblestones, and more.
- Added 23 fossil structures, where you can brush Suspicious Sand/Gravel for [Fossils](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Fossil). You can add [custom fossils using datapacks](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Fossils_File).
- Added the Data Monitor, Fossil Compartment, and Restoration Tank blocks. Placed in the correct formation, you can use these to create a [Restoration Machine](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Resurrection_Machine) where you can bring fossils back to life. Use organic material to fill the tank first!
- Added 3 variants of [Tumblestone](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Tumblestone), which can be planted near Lava or Magma to grow harvestable Tumblestone Clusters.
- Added Tumblestone Blocks, a storage block crafted from 9 Tumblestones.
- Added Ancient Poké Balls, which are aesthetic variants crafted from Tumblestones.
- Added the Ancient Feather, Wing, and Jet Balls, which fly further than regular Poké Balls.
- Added the Ancient Heavy, Leaden, and Gigaton Balls, which are heavier and don't fly as far as regular Poké Balls. These will receive more functionality in a future update.
- Added visual effects for many Poké Balls when sending out or capturing Pokémon.
- Added a new send-out ball toss animation that showcases the ball used for the Pokémon.
- Added simple move animations for Pokémon in battle with a proof of concept (Flamethrower) for more complicated animations. More and more specific animations will come in future updates.
- Added Original Trainer to the summary menu. To edit the OT through commands, you must specify originaltrainertype=<Player/NPC>, and originaltrainer=<Username or UUID/NPC Name>
- Added support for planting Apricorn trees, berries, and mints in [Botany Pots](https://modrinth.com/mod/botany-pots)
- Added the hidden "True Vivillionaire" advancement.
- Added the [Display Case](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Display_Case) block. Use it to display your archaeological findings, Poké Balls, or other items.
- Added 6 Pokémon-themed Pottery Sherds, obtained from ruin structures. Sherds... sh-erds. Weird word.
- Added a Pokémon-themed armor trim, obtained from ruin structures.
- Added Nether Fire Stone Ore to, surprisingly, the Nether.
- Added Terracotta Sun Stone Ore to Badlands biomes.
- Added the EV Boosting Feathers.
- Added [Gilded Chests](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Gilded_Chest), available in all Apricorn colors.
- Added Relic Coins, Relic Coin Pouches, and Relic Coin Sacks. Gimmighoul might be interested in these.
- Added Type Gems. These will have additional uses later, so you should start collecting them.
- Added new held items: Ability Shield, Absorb Bulb, Air Balloon, Binding Band, Blunder Policy, Cell Battery, Covert Cloak, Damp Rock, Eject Button, Eviolite, Expert Belt, Float Stone, Focus Sash, Heat Rock, Icy Rock, Iron Ball, Light Ball, Loaded Dice, Red Card, Shell Bell, Sticky Barb, Smooth Rock, Soothe Bell and Weakness Policy.
- Added Hisui starters to the starter selection menu. They come inside of ancient Poké Balls.
- Added a bubble quirk to Krabby that only plays during clear sunsets. It looks familiar...
- Added forfeit option to PVP battles.
- Added visual changes for entities affected by Illusion, Imposter, or Transform in battle.
- Added shoulder mounting for Squirtle, Ralts, Roggenrola, Charcadet, Sizzlipede, Litwick, Cutiefly, Flabebe, Flittle, and Scatterbug
- Added species data for Hydrapple, Iron Boulder, Iron Crown, Pecharunt, Raging Bolt, and Terapagos
- Added various new tags for search-ability and better mod compatibility.
- Added the [Ability Capsule](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability_Capsule) and [Patch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability_Patch). These have no way of getting them (for now) and only work as intended with the traditional ability format of 1 to 2 common abilities and 1 hidden ability.

- Added more held items to the held item tag, and Metal Coat to the held item tab.
- Added all ores to the modloader ore tags, and added tags for each ore type to the mod (both blocks and items).
- Changed the Destiny Knot to be crafted with a Ghast Tear rather than a diamond. We have big plans for the Destiny Knot...
- You can now punch grown apricorns to harvest them. We saw so many content creators breaking apricorns with their fists that it was making us die inside.
- The "Poké Ball" Vivillon variant is now obtainable by evolving a Spewpa after obtaining the "Aspiring Vivillionaire" advancement.
- Renamed the "Vivillionaire" advancement to "Aspiring Vivillionaire"
- Removed the Inferno, Forsaken, Poké Ball, and Void patterns from the Aspiring Vivillionaire advancement.
- Updated the biome tags for Spewpa's evolutions into the various Vivillon patterns. You should mostly be getting one evolution option at a time now.
- Apricorn Sprouts can now be planted directly on Apricorn leaves to create a new Apricorn of the same color.
- Added tooltips to interaction GUIs to make it clearer what they do.
- Poké Ball recipes now use tags for their center ingredient, rather than specifically Copper Ingots, Iron Ingots, Gold Ingots, and Diamonds, allowing for further datapack customisation and mod compatibility.
- Starter Toast now closes once the corresponding button is pressed once.
- Moved some items into the vanilla Food & Drinks category.
- Stacked Cobblemon Potion Bases can now be quick moved into Brewing Stands.
- Changed the Healing Machine recipe to swap the Max Revive for a Revive so that it is a bit easier to craft.

- Reorganised a few advancements.
- Pokémon entity shadows now scale when the Pokémon is being sent out or recalled.
- Remade Torkoal particles, now they only appear when in battle.
- Improved the shiny icon within summary and PC interfaces.
- Changed the Poison Barb sprite so that it doesn't look like a sword when held. It's a Poison Barb, not a Poison Sword. Wait, that gives me an idea.
- Moon Stone ore generates more frequently in Taigas and has been added to Magical and Spooky biomes. Ooo... Sorry.
- Density, Season, and Nether biome tags have been moved and renamed within the biome tags directory.
- Added particles to Lucario when in battle. Lucario is special.
- Movesets updated for Blueberry DLC.

### Fixes
- Re-added the recipe for the Iron vitamin. Well, technically it's a mineral.
- Fixed Exeggcute and Pikachu not being able to evolve.
- Fixed evolution priority for Exeggcute and Pikachu regional evolutions. Using a thunder stone on Kantonian Pikachu on the beach will give Alolan Raichu. A second thunder stone would then give Kantonian Raichu.
- Fixed battle text for the Poison Touch Ability.
- Finally found Sudowoodo and Bonsly. They were missing spawn data. Same with Drifloon and Litwick. Uh... sorry about that.
- Fixed Squawkabilly forms not being recognized.
- Fixed the bounce animation for Poké Balls being delayed by like, a full second. It's enough to drive you mad.
- Note blocks now play the correct sound on the Apricorn Plank-based blocks.
- Fixed an issue with transformed parts in posers causing whacky positional issues.
- Fixed Poké Balls freezing in an open state if you're looking away at the moment that it's meant to close. This actually fixes some other things but it's hard to explain.
- Fixed thrown Poké Balls technically having no name.
- Fixed very many issues with Bedrock particle effects. There are probably many more. Life goes on.
- Fixed Arbok patterns not being as specific in spawning as they were intended to be.
- Fixed Pokémon not avoiding danger at all when pathfinding.
- Fixed Pokémon pathing over snow layers and carpets.
- Fixed the Sobble line not being able to swim or breathe underwater.
- Fixed mod incompatibility with [Just Enough Resources](https://modrinth.com/mod/just-enough-resources-jer).
- Fixed mod incompatibility with [Visual Overhaul](https://modrinth.com/mod/visual-overhaul).
- Fixed an issue that allowed Pokémon to spawn on rails.
- Fixed the data set on Pokémon when abilities are given via properties such as in `/spawnpokemon`.
- Fixed Pokémon sometimes losing hidden abilities when evolving. This fix will only take effect for newly created Pokémon because of technical reasons that were explained to me but which I then forgot.
- Fixed capture messages not displaying in battle.
- Fixed the Illusion ability causing the wrong Pokémon to be targeted in battle.
- Fixed battles started with fainted party members causing a soft-lock on defeat.
- Fixed some issues with eyes in the faint animations of Hitmonlee and Phantump
- Fixed missing evolution moves, for example Stone Axe for Kleavor.
- Cleaned up empty evolutions declaration in species data (And no, I'm not listing all 169. No I don't care what you pay me, I'm not doing it).
- Fixed non-consumable held items being consumed or swapped in battle permanently.

### Developer
- Significantly changed the way the properties in PokemonEntity work. This could break some plugins (not in a big way, but changes will be needed for some things).
- Rebuilt the scheduling API to more clearly force side choices and temporal frames of reference for tasks. The developers say that how it works is cool but I stopped listening.
- Added dialogue API and data registry. This is powerful, and there is a full example in the Cobblemon mod you can trigger using `/opendialogue <username> cobblemon:example`. The example JSON is inside the data folder of the mod.
- Opened up the ItemDropEntry class to allow for it to be extended.
- Added a new "advancement" evolution variant that takes an advancement identifier and succeeds if the player has the advancement.
- Made the spawning API capable of non-entity spawning. You can make it 'spawn' commands if you want. Go nuts.
- Made `PokemonProperties.parse` more interoperable with Java. Save yourself and stop using Java.
- Added the `HeldItemEvent`, this comes with 2 implementation `HeldItemEvent.Pre` and `HeldItemEvent.Post`.
- Corrections to the ability implementation have been made that make `Ability.forced` function as intended and never reroll an ability for a Pokémon, please check your implementations to ensure the corrected behavior is intended for your use case.
- `Pokemon.ability` no longer has a public setter. Please migrate to using `Pokemon#updateAbility`, this handles the ability coordinate storage for you when necessary.
- `Ability.forced`, `Ability.index` and `Ability.priority` have all had their setters internalized, there is no longer any need to manually adjust these migrate to the method mentioned above to handle that process for you.
- `AbilityChanger` has been added to API alongside some implementations, this is subject to change as the ability capsule and patch currently only expect the traditional behaviour in the Pokémon games of 1 or 2 regular abilities and 1 hidden ability.
- `Pokemon#rollAbility` has been added which re9rolls for a legal ability for the Pokémon.
- `docs/cobblemon-tags` tags and spawn-presets can now be auto-generated from the current tags in the Cobblemon mod with the `generateSpawnPresetList.py` and `generateTagList.py` scripts.
- `public_spawns_to_json.py` script has been added to give the powerful spawn.json generator a simplistic UI.
- Updated Showdown with Gen 9 DLC.
- Changed mixins to be Java 17 for compatibility level instead of 16, removing a warning from startup logs.

### Datapack & Resourcepack Creators
- The maximum amount of fossils that can fit in the Fossil Analyzer can be adjusted in the config.
- Custom fossils can be defined using a list of items and the resulting Pokémon. An example of `aerodactyl.json`:
  `JSON
  {
    "result": "aerodactyl",
    "fossils": [
      "cobblemon:old_amber_fossil"
    ]
  }
  `
- Fetus models can be defined in `bedrock/fossils`.
- Fetus textures can be defined in `textures/fossils`.
- Fuel for the Restoration Machine is registered inside the `natural_materials` folder. To register more fuels, create a JSON file containing an array of objects. Each object supports the following fields:
    - `content`: Integer containing the amount of fuel to add.
    - `item` OR `tag`: Identifier of the item or item tag to be inserted.
    - `returnItem`: Identifier of an item to return to the player after consumption.
- Added 3 new item tags: `ancient_poke_balls`, `fossils`, and `tumblestones`.
- Added a spawn rules system to modify general spawning behaviour, see the [wiki](https://wiki.cobblemon.com/index.php/Spawn_Rules) for more information.
- Added dialogue datapack folder and `/opendialogue` command.
- Added the item tag `cobblemon:held/leaves_leftovers` this can be used to flag apple-like items that can create leftovers when eaten.
- You can now add support for dynamic lighting implementations, Cobblemon ships with a default implementation for [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) and the [Dynamic Lights Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged), add the following to any species or form:
  `JSON
  {
    "lightingData": {
      "lightLevel": 14,
      "_lightLevelCommentRemoveMe": "Above supports 0 to 15",
      "liquidGlowMode": "LAND",
      "_liquidGlowModeCommentRemoveMe": "Above supports LAND, UNDERWATER or BOTH"
    }
  }
  `
- Following up on this change `light_source` was removed as a possible shoulder effect due to becoming unnecessary and never having had a default implementation.
- Added the item tag `cobblemon:ability_changers`, contains the `cobblemon:ability_capsule` & `cobblemon:ability_patch` by default.
- Added the item tag `cobblemon:held/is_friendship_booster`, allows items to give the Soothe Bell effect of a boost of 1.5x Friendship gained, contains `cobblemon:soothe_bell` by default.
