#### "Now that there's a fishing mechanic, the mod is actually good!"

### Additions
- Added the Pokédex as a craftable item that can be placed on lecterns.
- Added Pokémon (and item) fishing using modified fishing rods - Poké Rods! You'll need a Poké Rod smithing template, a fishing rod, and some type of Poké Ball. Each Poké Ball makes a differently themed rod because it's cool.
- Added Lure Ball functionality, increasing the catch rate of Pokémon that were caught on a fishing rod.
- Added Repeat Ball functionality, increasing the catch rate of Pokémon that are already registered as caught in a player's Pokédex.

- Added support for Double Battles, Triple Battles, and Multi-battles.
- Added raft platforms for non-swimming, non-flying Pokémon to stand on during battles that take place on the water's surface (Flying Pokémon will fly over water in battle, and water breathing Pokémon will swim in water during battle).
- Added smarter send-out positions for Pokémon in battle. They should get in your way less!

- Added a `natural` block state property for the healing machine block; when property is set to true, the block will have a different texture and drop an iron ingot instead of itself.
- Added a `battleInvulnerability` gamerule to make players invulnerable to any damage during a battle.
- Added a `mobTargetInBattle` gamerule to exclude players from being targeted by mobs during a battle.
- Added a `/freezepokemon` command to pause a Pokémon's animation at a specific point in time.
- Added `/spawnnpc` and `/spawnnpcat` commands.

- Added `aspect` and `unaspect` PokemonProperty arguments (which also includes commands such as `/pokemonedit`, `/spawnpokemon`, and `/givepokemon`) to allow forcing or un-forcing an aspect on a Pokémon.
- Added `type` alternatively `elemental_type` PokemonProperty argument, this is only used for filtering and is not applied to Pokémon. Example `type=fire` would be true for Charmander but false for Squirtle.

### Developer
- `SpawnCause` is now an implementation of `SpawningInfluence`.
- Many types related to `Pokemon` including itself now have dedicated `Codec`, please migrate to them from the NBT/JSON/PacketBuffer write/read methods.
- `PokemonBattle` now starts on turn 0.
- Renamed Pokemon.hp to Pokemon.maxHealth to make it clearer. Backwards compatibility is provided but it is an active deprecation, please migrate away from it.
- Serialization of PokemonStores and Pokemon themselves now require registry access, which will break some sidemods. This sucked for us more than it will suck for you! If you have a world or player instance, you can get it from there.
- ``TeraTypes`` now implements ``Iterable``.
- Added `forcedAspects` to Pokémon to make it easier to easily add basic aspects to a Pokémon in a way that persists. We already know that everyone is going to overuse this.
- Made the `Pokemon.aspects` setter private. This could technically break side-mods but if you are affected by this then you were using it wrong! Use `Pokemon.forcedAspects` to fix it.
- Cobblemon's main logger is properly static now.
- `PokemonEntity.enablePoseTypeRecalculation` can be used to disable automatic pose type recalculation.
- Added CollectEggEvent and HatchEggEvent for compatibility usage.
- Added events for:
    - Showdown Instructions
    - Mega Showdown Instruction
    - Terastallize Showdown Instruction
    - ZPower Showdown Instruction
    - Bait Consumed, Bait Set, and an event to register custom BaitEffect Functions
    - Bobber Bucket Chosen
    - Bobber Spawn Pokémon
    - Pokérod Cast
    - Pokérod Reel
    - Pokémon Heal (with context)
        - Added HealingSource, an interface applied to all sources of healing from player actions, for easier tracking of healing sources.
    - Move Change
    - Shiny Chance Calculation Event (with player context)
    - Dex Information Changed (Pre and Post); this event is fired when the Pokédex is updated with new information.
- Rebuilt large swaths of the model animation code to simplify it.
- Renamed a bunch of things from %Poseable% to %Posable% because spelling.
- Renamed StatelessAnimation to PoseAnimation.
- Renamed StatefulAnimation to ActiveAnimation.
- Documented the animation system.
- Allowed for SpawnSnowstormEntityParticleHandler to handle non-posable entities (due to being non-posable, locators are useless - to set the offset use the settings in the particle itself).
- Added property chaining support for duplicate CustomPokemonPropertyType elements.

### Data Pack & Resource Pack Creators
- Added experimental `flow` datapack directory for handling events using MoLang event handlers.
- Added support for "shedders" similar to Shedinja's evolution logic.

- Added MoLang compatibility in the isVisible property for transformed parts.
- Added `q.has_aspect('some_aspect')` function to animations, posers, and entity particle effects.
