- Added an implementation of every [catch rate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate) from generation 1 to 9, these can be used by changing the `captureCalculator` config value:
    - `generation_1` Sets the calculator to the generation 1 implementation.
    - `generation_2` Sets the calculator to the generation 2 implementation.
    - `generation_2_fixed` Sets the calculator to the generation 2 implementation with the status multiplier bug fixed.

    - `debug` Sets the calculator to the debug/cheat implementation, every attempt will be a successful critical capture.

### Changes
- Pokémon now save to the world by default, meaning the same Pokémon will remain in the world and not disappear after you log out and log back in. They still despawn over time though.
- Significantly sped up the Poké Ball shake animation so it takes less time to try to catch Pokémon.
- Update the PC and Healing Machine models and bounding boxes.
- The Healing Machine and PC now emit light when fully charged or when turned on respectively.
- The PC block screen will now turn on when being used.
- The Healing Machine will now visually display its charge level using 6 stages.
- The Healing Machine will now emit a redstone signal with the strength of 1 for every 10% charge it has when attached to a [Redstone Comparator](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_Comparator).
- Made it so that particles are not shown whenever you have a shoulder Pokémon that gives potion effects.
- Changed hitbox and size definitions for Decidueye, Blastoise, and Magmortar
- Apricorns can now be harvested with Axes, the speed will scale with enchantments and tool material, only dropping the Apricorn if fully grown, these will still destroy the Apricorn so the manual harvest still is recommended unless you're just keen on destroying trees.
- Apricorns are now a part of the vanilla tag `minecraft:blocks/mineable/axe`.
- Apricorns are now compatible with any mod that breaks a whole tree at once.
- Apricorns no longer have a config value for the seed drop chance these are now a part of their loot table which can be found in `cobblemon/loot_tables/blocks/<color>_apricorn.json`.
- Advancements were redone to be slightly more interesting, with improved names, descriptions, and sorting.
- Updated models and textures for Tentacool line, Gengar, Slowpoke line, Tyrogue line, Doduo line, Dratini, Dragonair, Quagsire, and Piplup line. There were probably others, the team lost track.
- Improved sending out Pokémon at the start of battle so that they are positioned in a less annoying way.
- Name Tags will no longer be used on Pokémon and Poke Ball entities, this prevents the item from being wasted.
- Lowered spawn rate of Tauros.
- Sableye now spawns near gem ores as well as amethyst.
- Added evolution stones and items to item tags
- Pokémon now play their cry animations when clicked on the starter selection screen.
